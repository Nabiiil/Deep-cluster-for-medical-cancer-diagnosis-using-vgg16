# Deep-cluster-for-medical-cancer-diagnosis-using-vgg16

This project enters the field of unsupervised learning, in particular deep clustering, which aims to properly classify unannotated data using classic clustering algorithms, such as kmeans and Birch, and use transfer learning to optimize work. In this composition, we show in stages the exploration of the data, extracting features, classifying these features and fine tuning our model which is based on the pre-trained VGG-16 network.
we succeeded in constructing a deep cluster model, which allows to classify the images well as shown by the results in the section.

The results were generally good and satisfactory. Our design can be improved by doing the similarity testing to select reliable training samples in order to avoid redundancy in our model.

Generally, the deep clustering task was successfully as the model was able to adapt and recognize clusters of different type of images. Therfore, deep learning and domain adaptation are considerably the key to improve the field of pathology AI, especially, for pathology data that has not yet been processed.
